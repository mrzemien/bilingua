Ever dreamed on rising a bilingual child or have you just come with your family to the U.S.? You want your kids to have a good start at school? Make it easier with us!
It's so exciting to observe children's development. We offer English and German classes for children aging 4-6 years. In this age they acquire the language naturally and almost effortless and it's so much fun to introduce the new language through singing, games, movement, story-telling or role-play. The instructions are always accompanied by a demonstration so we are sure that our young learners are clear about the given task. They have our full support on their way to understand and use the new language. We offer a range of activities for each lesson and follow kids' interests. We know how challenging but in the same time rewarding it can be to inspire and motivate young learners. We are aware that children love discovering things so we want to mix learning and play and create a cheerful and supportive atmosphere which will follow up in your kid's success.
